                                        <p>
                                            I have studied monetary policy for over 30 years. I am a disciple of Austrian Economics and an opponent of Keynesianism and the fiat money systems around the world. Most of all, I believe that Bitcoin (and Blockchain Technology) is truly one of the greatest gifts we have given ourselves, for the new Millennium. It is sound money, by definition and will endure long after the fiat schemes have failed. I think we will soon be ushering in a new age where sound money reigns supreme and Bitcoin is certain to be one of the most trusted forms of money, around the world.

                                            <p>Amber is a self-described “compliance nerd” with broad financial experience that includes banking, investments, insurance and most recently cryptocurrency and blockchain.  She firmly believes that good compliance can be good business when it’s done right.  In the interest of doing it right, she launched Outlier Solutions Inc. in 2013, where she continues to offer consulting services as well as a suite of on-line, on-demand products.</p>

                                            <strong>Why would you be a good director of the BAC?</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I’m a former banker and current consultant who had a “Welcome to Satoshi” moment in 2013 when a good friend and client asked me to update his risk assessment to include bitcoin. I had read very little on the topic, and that was limited to popular media and academic papers, so I asked that he pay my retainer in bitcoin.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Since then, I have worked with both established companies and startups. I believe that blockchain technology will change our world in ways that we can’t yet imagine. I love the passion that so many technology entrepreneurs are bringing to the forefront in Canada, and it would be my honour to serve that community as a director of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance.

                                            These insights have led me down some fascinating paths in the realms of health, film, finance, science, politics and technology. Through my various professional pursuits I have been able to build successful relationships with the numerous Fortune 500 companies and governmental bodies. I have deep technical background that I leverage from working at a high-level role for seven years at BlackBerry, where I managed people, technologies and communications. Since that time I have been involved in the first 100 Million dollar Bitcoin company in 2013, formed one of Canada’s 1st Bitcoin consultancies as well as worked in an Advisor role for several of the top blockchains in the industry. I am also currently involved in some very exciting blockchain projects within Canada and outside of.

                                        <p>
                                            The common theme with working alongside my partners is simply that I leave each and every one of them better off for sharing the experience. My goal is always the same:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Success through honesty, integrity and hard work. The kicker? We always have fun while we accomplish it, and do not let anyone ever tell you it cannot be done this way.. Have a great day and make sure you find the time to smile : )
                                        </p>
                                            <strong>Why would you be a good director of the BAC?</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        I will bring a unique skill set to the BAC in that I have a deep technical background as well as proven leadership and communication skills. Being in the Bitcoin and Blockchain industry since 2012 I believe I am well prepared to help the Bitcoin Alliance raise its profile not only within Canada but eventually on an international stage.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        I also feel a certain level of emotional intelligence is required to be successful in this role. My background in various leadership roles in Fintech will allow me to help the BAC meet their mandate of being good custodians of both Bitcoin and Blockchain technology within Canada.

                                            <p><strong>Biography</strong>:</p>  

                                            <p>Since 2007 Matthew Hamilton has founded and managed two junior mining companies and a consulting company focused in financial and underwriting services. In addition he held the position of Chief Financial Officer at Emperor Oil Ltd (TSX:EM) and Manager of Corporate Communications at Kimber Resources Inc. (TSX: KBR / NYSE AMEX: KBX).  Mr. Hamilton holds a B.Sc in Natural Resource Management as well as a Masters degree with focused studies in finance, economics and management.</p>

                                            <p>Matthew has a strong background in finance and management. He spent five years, both in university and in an engineering capacity, gaining an understanding of resource management. From 2006-2014 Mr. Hamilton worked primarily in financial markets in an investment banking, accounting, managerial and corporate communications capacity.</p>

His travels brought him all over Central America, where he created a home base in San Juan Del Sur, Nicaragua. Living and creating businesses in the hemisphere’s second poorest country, Matthew has learned to adapt to unknown and often chaotic circumstances in a short time frame.  The experience has also allowed him time and space to focus intensive studies in probability, behaviour, strategy and programming.</p>

                                        I’m excited to continue growing Bitcoin / Blockchain adoption in Canada. Along with my co-founder at Netcoins, in May we filmed a segment for CBC’s Dragons’ Den to promote Bitcoin, plus I regularly volunteer my time to give talks on Bitcoin & Blockchain.</p>

                                        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time speaking with business owners and consumers to grow  Bitcoin adoption in Canada as well. Education & awareness is still a big factor to encourage newcomers to adopt Bitcoin.</p>

                                            <p>Born in Toronto in 1980, I grew up outside the city in Mississauga.  I am first generation Canadian and my parents are from Spain and India.  My family briefly moved to London, England for 4 years where my sister was born, we later moved back to Mississauga in 1987.  My first investments began as a 17 year old into mutual funds and later equities. Growing up in Mississauga I then moved to Waterloo to attend Wilfrid Laurier University in 2000.  After a year and a half, my entrepreneurial tendencies got the better of me so I dropped out in 2002 to start a real estate investment/consulting company with a business partner.  During this time I was involved with another business startup, where I learned additional first hand sales, marketing and business development skills. A few years later I would spend 7 years with an insurance company startup as a high level claims operational manager, simultaneously still running my private equity company Harlow Equities Ltd.   Throughout this time, I have been an avid investor which led me to discover bitcoin in 2012.  Making my first investments in Bitcoin in earlier 2013 I was blown away at what I was experiencing first hand, months followed and my investments into the blockchain space began. With extensive knowledge in bitcoin venture capital, crypto currency investing and consulting, fin-tech and blockchain domains, I have been privileged in my experiences over the past 4 years in the industry.  With a passion for people and crypto, I look forward to continuing spreading the good word of the blockchain!</p>

                                            <p>In 2014, Michael and his brother Dominic co-founded Netcoins (www.goNetcoins.com), creating & launching “virtual” Bitcoin ATMs designed for selling Bitcoin in retail stores (more info: www.goNetcoins.com), currently launched in 7,000 stores in Canada and Australia.

Also, being an avid participant in the industry for the past 4 years, I have helped many Canadians explore and navigate this new exciting industry.  I believe my skill set, passion and work ethic will be of great value to the BAC and assisting in the Canadian blockchain adoption!

                                        <p>
                                        I am the current Chair of the BAC and I am looking forward to help drive our mission and vision forward in 2017: http://bitcoinalliance.ca/

                                    <p>
                                        There is still much work to do around merchant adoption, friendlier user experience, regulatory clarification, the opening of bank accounts for BTC startups and trading accounts around the world, closing the gap between innovation and regulatory roadblocks (who have legitimate concerns around compliance, consumer protection, KYC, AML, ant-terrorism, the list goes on); or banks threatened when they have to comply but seeing startups straying into their turf while challenging regulatory hurdles or attempting to leapfrog it. In reality, the startups are simply overwhelmed by the dearth of requirements to play on the financial institutionsâ€™ turf and their terms.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is the time to redouble our efforts and ensure that the fight is just not just on the frontlines, but also where it really matters. With people who can apply this for their personal benefit and in their daily lives.

                                            <p><strong>Biography</strong>:</p>  

                                            <p>A serial entrepreneur and long-time bitcoin enthusiast, Dave co-founded Bitcoin Brains, Calgary’s first bitcoin brokerage in 2013. Since that time, he has grown to become widely regarded as an expert on both technological and financial sides of bitcoin and blockchain technology.</p>

                                            <strong>Why would you be a good director of the BAC?</strong>
                                        <p>
                                        I believe that bitcoin is an important tool for free speech in Canada and around the world and I will fight to keep it that way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Right now Canada is a world leader in bitcoin and blockchain technology.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To fully take advantage of this opportunity we need to make sure that Canada avoids the same mistakes made in New York with the BitLicence. Over-regulation kills innovation and kills small businesses.

                                            <strong>Why would you be a good director of the BAC?</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        I am currently involved in various efforts in the Bitcoin & Blockchain space in Canada (and abroad, eg. India) to bring main stream adoptance of these innovative technologies to the fore-front.  As a Co-Organizer and Founder of the biggest Bitcoin/Blockchain events in Canada, we have been promoting the current environment and future growth of this burgeoning ecosystem in this country.  I have also been an advisor and helped the Bitcoin Alliance in the past and would love to continue to be involved in making this industry even greater than what it is in Canada today through active participation in the Alliance.</p>

                                        <p>With an online presence and an audience in the hundreds of thousands of followers (personally and for my startups) across multiple social media platforms, I am able to get word out for events, and industry news and foster activity around these really quickly.  Whether it is LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or a myriad of other venues, you will always see me promotion Bitcoin & Blockchain to everybody and anybody.  I am a firm believer in the Brute Force method of marketing which advises to get your message out to as many people as possible at every given time to maximize your chance of virality.</p>

                                        <p>I believe there are still tons of things to be done to increase user awareness, government knowledge, merchant adoption and general positive viewpoints/opinions of this industry at large.  Banking access for startups in the industry has also been very lacking in Canada, and I hope to be able to open communications and foster positive change with regulators and the banking sector as well.</p> 

                                        <p>Having founded multiple startups in the industry and having gone through the rigorous requirements to both adhere to existing AML/KYC standards and regulations in Canada and worldwide, I am able to bring much needed grassroots experience to the Board.  The startup ecosystem and the jobs it will create in this industry in Canada are just starting to see some exposure and phenomenal growth, and I will continue to focus on expanding and bringing clarity to government, public and private sector individuals about the benefits of this innovative new platform for Black Swan events.</p>
